## Let's Learn Java
This is a collection of some lessons that could help you, person who doesn't necessarily have any programming experience, learn a little bit about Java. These guides are written exactly for that audience: someone who doesn't have any experience with programming, but maybe wants to!

The concepts here are treated simply and will not necessarily go into complete detail. This is by design as this course is intended to be a light introduction. There are many, many, many course out there that will go into more depth and prepare you for more intensive usages. But, hopefully, after completing the lessons here you'll have a taste for programming.

## How to use
The lessons are intended to be followed in order. It's recommended that you create a folder per lesson to store your
files that you'll create. A lot of the code for each lesson can be downloaded from [the lessons directory on GitHub](https://github.com/R3volv360/Java101/tree/master/lessons).
