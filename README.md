# Java101

My sister-in-law was considering taking computer science at high school. I've decided to upload this to the greater
internet in case they might be useful for others (and GitHub gives me easy markdown rendering, so its a win-win).

## How to use

In the `lessons/` directory there will be a `.md` (markdown) file which will the have high level points. There will also
be any relevant `.java` files in there as well.

Start by reading through the markdown file. It'll be broken up into sections of doing and discussing. Right now they are
both pretty light on detail because the courses are largely instructor led at the moment (I might come back and change
that in the future). However, they still should be easily enough understood standalone.

Lessons are intended to be followed in order, i.e. first `00`, then `01`, then `02` and so on.

Every lesson, unless told otherwise, will assume that you are running in a single directory. You can clone this
repository and use its structure if you'd like, but unless you see a `cd` command, you should be creating files and
running commands all in a single directory.

The lessons were written on an x86 Mac. Things should just work on other operating systems and while I'll try remain
OS-agnostic, I have been writing these up in a Mac environment so some macOS-isms might slip through!
